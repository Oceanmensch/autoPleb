# autoPleb
A helpful WoW Classic addon for spitting on spendies

Unzip in your /Interface/AddOns directory.

Working only with TBC Classic (for now).


Under Interface> Options there are options for a Poggers and Family mode, with an implicit Unpoggers mode. 

After that, just click on players, and the addon does the rest. 

Enjoy!
